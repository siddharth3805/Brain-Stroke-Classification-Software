### 📘 Project Name:
**Brain Stroke Prediction using Deep Learning (CNN)**

---

### 🧩 Project Abstract:
Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide.  
Early and accurate detection of stroke from brain imaging is critical for timely treatment and improved patient outcomes.  

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to automatically classify brain X-ray or CT images as **Normal** or **Stroke**.  
The system enables **fast and reliable preliminary screening**, helping healthcare professionals prioritize patients and reduce diagnosis time.
